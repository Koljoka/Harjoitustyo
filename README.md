The chosen project is a Tic Tac Toe game. The application launches with a MainPage, where the user is prompted to enter their personal details, as well as choose an opponent they wish to play against. The user can choose either another player or AI as their opponent. Additionally, the homepage features a Scoreboard button, which redirects to another page displaying statistics of registered players and their previous games. From the homepage, the game can be initiated by pressing the StartGame button, after which the user is directed to the actual game page. This page includes a timer displaying the duration of the game, and a NewGame button, allowing the game to be reset and started over at any point.

On the MainPage, the player's personal details are saved to a record, and on the game page, the results of the games along with the total time spent playing are recorded. These details are then presented on the Scoreboard page when the user navigates there.
